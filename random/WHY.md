I built Dappnet because I wanted to see it exist. I am the audience, and this is the experience I want from crypto. 

Dappnet's audience is the average person. We don't care about being the best in every category - browsing, wallets, P2P storage, P2P chat, NFT's. We care about how people feel when there are no categories - no need for separate extensions, to connect to .eth websites. No need to find, install and configure a wallet - like Metamask/Rainbow. No need to find a separate transaction simulation extension, or configure custom RPC nodes for each blockchain. These are anti-features. In 10 years, we will consider it funny that users had to _make_ so many choices to use crypto. Progress doesn't look like more choices, it looks like fewer. And the trust we build is by making the right ones by default, and giving people the option to decide what's best for them. When I think of decentralization, I come back to this quote by Hayek:

> If we can agree that the economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place, it would seem to follow that the ultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances,

Dappnet's mission is to deliver real decentralization with great UX. Eliminating the liability of hosting frontends, connecting you securely to Ethereum and other networks, and providing the best-in-class user experience for interacting with them. It is not just a bundling/unbundling play - but an approach to values. Do you want to live in a world full of features soullessly packed together into software? Or do you want something more?
