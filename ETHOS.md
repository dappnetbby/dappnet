It's funny how life loops around. 10yrs ago, when I was ?15?, instead of drinking booze and having sex, I was being a nerd and interested in [building decentralized DNS](https://github.com/liamzebedee/D3NS).

BitTorrent is the OG of P2P technology. And it's freaking usable - everyone I know knows how to download torrents. IPFS is so much harder, **even as developers** IPFS's API's are notoriously confusing.

What happened if browsing the web was like one big torrent? If every website you visited was downloaded from a P2P swarm? And nothing could be censored. That's what Dappnet is.
