Backpack/xNFT's may seem similar to dappnet, but have pretty different realisations of their direction

both are somewhat decentralized
xNFT's are hosted on arweave, and cached by the CDN. Backpack must run a CDN, kind of like how Infura runs nodes for Metamask.
Dappnet apps are hosted by IPFS nodes. Anyone can become a host and it can be just as performant (if not more performant)

xNFT's are designed using the Backpack framework. This framework is fast and easy. You won't get feature-rich apps like Uniswap dashboards though. 
Dapps and websites on Dappnet are designed using JS/HTML/CSS. Dappnet is inherently compatible with the existing ecosystem - ie. even vitalik's website, vitalik.eth, is compatible with Dappnet. 

Maybe in future, dappnet will modify HTML - Hyperstructure Text Markup Language https://twitter.com/ZORAEngineering/status/1600968806645780480
ie.

how to incorporate nft's / provenance?

what does it contain?
